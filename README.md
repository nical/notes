# Notes

This repository contains a collection of notes for my own use.

It is convenient to put them on github for back-up purposes and occasionally sharing some notes with colleagues, however these notes are not intended to be shared with a large audience. So while anyone is welcome to read them, please note that:
 - They are very incomplete and unpolished.
 - They might contain blocks of copy-pasted text from wikipedia or other sources without necessarily crediting them, so please be mindful about sharing anything you find here verbatim.
 - They contain internal links to some documents that are not in the repository (typically the pdfs of papers, documentation and talk slides) so they'll be some dead links.
